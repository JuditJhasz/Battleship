# Battleship
Multiplayer Battleship game in Java (and JavaFX)

This project is a Battleship game capable of managing multiple games.
The communication is through sockets. 
There is a bug which I could not fix yet, it occurs sometimes when 
connecting to a game. This case if you restart the game it will be fine.
There is an extra feature, once in a game a player can move one of their ships. 
If the ship was injured, the injuries also move with the ship.
